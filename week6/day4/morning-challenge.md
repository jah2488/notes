# Morning Group Challenge

In groups of 2 (or 3 if needed) write up a series of UMLs for reddit.com

Based on the URLs you see figure out what database tables and attributes on those tables would be needed if you were to write reddit in rails.

Draw arrows between each UML box to show the relation. If UML Model A belongs to UML Model B and B has many A then the array should go from A to B.
